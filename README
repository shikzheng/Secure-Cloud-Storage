Secure cloud storage


The PEM password for both client and server is: password


List of Files:
Makefile
server/
client/
storage/
scripts/
presentation
source files


Makefile:
A simple makefile that will compile the programs for you. Running the
following commands will perform the following actions:
make	    #builds the client and the server executables
make server #builds the server executable (for portability)
make client #builds the client executable (for portability)


server/
The server directory contains files needed by the server executable. They
include the server certificate, server private key, and client certificate
authority.


client/
The client directory contains files needed by the client executable. They
include the client certificate, client private key, server certificate
authority, and source code for cross platform dialogs.


storage/
The storage directory is where the cloud server will put the uploaded files.
This can be modified by changing the S_DIR macro in the server source.


scripts/
The scripts directory contains a BASH script to generate self-signed
certificates. Normally it is not okay to use self-signed certificates, but
in this case it is okay because we know that we are the ones who are signing
it.
To run the script:
./Lee-Zheng-crt.sh <name>


Running the programs:
After compiling and building from source, there will be two executables:
Lee-Zheng-server and Lee-Zheng-client.
To run the server: ./Lee-Zheng-server <port>
To run the client: ./Lee-Zheng-client <hostname:port>
(It will display this if it receives invalid arguments)

After running the server and connecting to it via the client, the following
prompt will be displayed:
o - options
u - upload
d - download
l - list
r - remove
q - quit

o   will list these options again
u   will open a prompt when a file can be selected to upload
d   will list the files stored on the server and allow you to choose a file	to download
l   will list the files stored on the server (will not show hidden files)
r   will list the files stored on the server and allow you to choose a file	to remove from the server


How it works:
The client and server exchange certificates to set up a TLS connection. If
either provides no certificate or an invalid certificate, the connection
will be dropped. The certificates are password protected so even if someone
were to gain access to them, they would not be able to use them. We use the
ECDHE_ECDSA_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 cipher suite, which is the same scheme that
Google Drive uses, to encrypt the data. To ensure that someone with access
to the server cannot view the data, we use client-sided AES_128_GCM for
encryption and integrity.
